Aut√¥Meta (automatic meta data annotation) is an environment for semi-automatic (or automatic) annotation and meta-annotation of documents for publishing on the Web using  RDFa,  a W3C recommended annotation language. It also includes a RDFa extraction tool  to provide the user with a view of the annotated triples. It is available in both *CLI* (Command Line Interface) and *GUI* (Graphical User Interface) interfaces.
